# Austin-Housing-Market-Analysis
Uncovering the key drivers of home prices in one of America's fastest-growing cities.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes over 15,000 property listings in the Austin, Texas metro area to identify the most influential factors affecting home prices. Using a combination of statistical analysis, geospatial mapping, and machine learning, we explore how property features, neighborhood attributes, and geographic location shape housing values.

ðŸŽ¯ Business Problem
As Austinâ€™s real estate market becomes increasingly competitive, homebuyers, investors, and policymakers need data-driven insights into what drives pricing. This analysis answers critical questions like:

What are the strongest predictors of home value?

Do schools and neighborhood factors significantly impact price?

How do prices vary across ZIP codes and build years?

ðŸ§° Methods
Descriptive Statistics: Median, mean, and distribution of key metrics

Geospatial Mapping: Home price heatmaps by ZIP code

Comparative Analysis: Pricing differences by home type and features

Regression Modeling: Multiple Linear Regression & Random Forest

Outlier Detection: Special treatment for extreme values

Feature Engineering: Encoding and transformation of home attributes


ðŸ“Š Key Findings
Living area, lot size, home type, and location are the top predictors of price

Garage, view, and heating/cooling systems add significant value

Spa and HOA membership had little impact on pricing

ZIP codes near downtown Austin command the highest prices

School ratings had only a mild positive influence
